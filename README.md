## **Final Release**

### **Highlights**

We have implemented our recommendation system that leverages user clickthroughs (data which we have been systematically collecting since the previous milestone). BuyWise now analyzes each user's product clicks to build personalized profiles and deliver intelligent product recommendations tailored to individual preferences and browsing behavior.

Additionally, BuyWise now features an advanced personalized AI filter that customizes product results during chat interactions. This intelligent filtering system ensures that products returned align with users' desired characteristics such as budget preferences, brand inclinations, and other specific requirements based on their previous queries and interactions.

### **Demo**
