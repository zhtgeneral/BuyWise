# BuyWise
BuyWise is a web application designed to streamline the online shopping experience by connecting users to their desired products quickly and efficiently across a wide range of popular e-commerce platforms. Our app will allow users to search for items across platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Kijiji using natural language – it will retrieve and display products from third-party platforms in an attractive interface, while providing AI-driven recommendations based on past searches and enabling account customization for more personalized shopping experiences. We plan to collect and store users’ age ranges, consumer preference behaviour (interests, brand preferences), apparel sizes, and conversation history with the language model to continuously improve account personalization and enhance how effectively the LLM tailors its responses to each user’s interests. More specifically, this data will be used to improve LLM prompts to generate better shopping queries across platforms and suggest complementary products based on past searches and purchase history. If time permits, we aim to expand support for more e-commerce platforms and explore training a predictive machine learning model to deliver more accurate item suggestions, moving beyond relying solely on an LLM to make recommendations.
